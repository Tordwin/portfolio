                    Italy may be a place where tourists thrive and moods are high with happiness but it comes with its dangers.<br>
                    Having seen victims of crimes such as pick-pock/mugging, Italy is not a place to ease up on your personal belongings.<br>
                    This section of this website is dedicated to preventing crime and making sure you as the visitor are safe and protected at all costs.

                    Crime in Italy, although petty (this includes pick-pocking, mugging, bag snatching, etc.) is very popular during the daytime.<br>
                    Crowded transportation such as the subway is a high crime area where criminals work in groups consisting of 2 or 3 individuals.<br>
                    One will grab the items they wish to steal and hand them quickly without the victim noticing.<br>
                    Once it is handed off to the other individual, the victim can no longer know who truly has his/her items.<br>
                    Preventing this from happening is difficult when in a compact area such as a subway but keeping your items in view at all times can prevent criminals from attempting.<br>
                    Moving your important items into a secured zipped bag that is carried from the front (backpack on belly) can help.<br>
                    The back/butt pockets of pants are an easy pickpocket for criminals as when distracted enough the victim would not be able to feel their item being taken from there.<br>
                    Either keep your items in a zipped pocket or keep them in your front pockets as they will have to reach further to grab your items.<br>
                    Always try to avoid walking at night alone or through poorly lit areas. Criminals will use the darkness to target for a mugging.<br>
                    If you are an unfortunate victim of a crime, call <strong>112 for medical assistance, 113 for the police, and 115 for the firefighters</strong>.

                    Terrorism in European countries is still possible and likely.<br>
                    According to the Prime Minister of Australia for advice on travel to Italy, bombings are frequent against political targets.<br>
                    Keep this in mind and be sure to check the local news in case an event were to occur. Proceed to large political rallies at your own risk.

                    <br>
                    Environmental disasters do strike Italy frequently. There are large earthquakes and depending on where you are staying could determine your risk factor.<br>
                    Earthquakes are known for creating landslides and avalanches so be warry during your trip to the countryside.<br>
                    Italy also experiences volcanic activity but is not a big problem until the drier months. The volcanic activities can ignite forest fires so if there is one nearby,<br>
                    <strong>dial 115 for the nearest fire brigade</strong> and get away from the fire as soon as possible.
