                <p>
                    Italy has a diverse climate as there are regions in the Alpine and Mediterranean.<br>
                    In northern regions such as Milan, during the Winter temperatures often drop below freezing whilst during the summer they stay warm.<br>
                    In central Italy in cities like Rome, they experience climate that is mild. They have wet (rainy) winters and dry, hot summers.<br>
                    In coastal cities or Southern cities like Sicily, it is similar to central Italy but have milder temperatures due to being on the coast.<br>

                    <strong>A Note from the Author:</strong><br>
                    If you would like to visit Italy in the summer it is best to always have a water bottle on you at all times. The summers can reach over 100 degrees.<br>
                    Wear sunscreen and bring plenty of cold objects (eat gelato :D) as risk of heat stroke increases as the day goes by. Summer nights do get chilly so bring a sweater if needed.<br>
                    Read the map provided above to plan your next vacation if you dispise cold or hot weathers and remember, drink water!
