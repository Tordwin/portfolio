                    Italy is historically and culturally rich with religious diversity but the predominant religion in Italy is Christianity, with many of the population belief in the Roman Catholic.<br>
                    The Roman Catholic Church played a significant role in the history of Italy, the arts, and the culture.
                    <br><br>
                    Although Roman Catholicism is prominent, there are also other Christian groups present which includes groups of Protestant communities.<br>
                    The Orthodox Church is present in communities with historical ties to the Eastern Orthodox. They give knowledge of the traditions and pursue them as well.
                    <br><br>
                    Judaism is also present in Italy (although not shown in the image) and dates back to ancient times.<br>
                    Major cities like Rome and Venice have historical Jewish households and Jewish residents.
                    <br><br>
                    Islam is practiced by a minority in Italy. They are primarily immigrants and their descendants.
                    <br><br>
                    There are small communities of Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, and other religious groups, which reflects the melting pot that Italy is.
                    <br><br>
                    It is also important to take note of Italy's religious landscape as some may have belief in no religions/secular.<br>
                    There are no laws preventing what religion one believes in and is a country that grants its citizens freedom of religion.
