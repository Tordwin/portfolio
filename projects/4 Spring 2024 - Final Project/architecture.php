                                Depending on where Italy's residents lived, architects had to build their way to better provide for the individuals.<br>
                                This example can be seen in Venice where canals and above sea level buildings can be seen to combat living on water.<br>
                                These architects also relied heavily on historical influences and local traditions.<br>
                                These can be seen in the unique architecture of Venice with its canals.
