                One topic that deserves to have its own page is Jeremy Wade’s near death experience whilst traveling to a remote village in the Amazon. <br>
                The crew and Wade himself were in a plane when the airplane’s engine failed. There was nothing they could do and the best they could hope for was a wet piece of land that could cushion their landing. 
                From a YouTube AMA (Asking Me Anything) we are told that Wade and his crew were only a second and a half away from being more likely to die from drowning as the water was up to their heads.
