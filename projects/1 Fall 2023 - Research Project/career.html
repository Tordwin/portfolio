                    Born on <strong>March 23, 1956</strong> in Ipswich, England Jeremy Wade has always been interested in fishing.
                As a child living on the banks of River Stour in Suffolk he was drawn to the sight of the river calling his name. 
                He attempts to catch fish at the age of 7 but fails to have any type of luck. 
                Through his friends from his school he is given guidance and catches his first fish. 
                With the support from his parents he always wanted to fish in different places leading to where he is today.

	                Wade took his first big trip to India in the year of 1982. 
                With only £200 in his pocket he managed to catch a fish called the Himalayan mahseer and clocked the weight in at 18 pounds.
                With this accomplishment he returned to England and started writing articles on his experience for a fishing magazine quoting, 
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                    “Despite the discomfort of traveling at such a basic level, there was a real feeling of achievement and I immediately started saving money to go somewhere else. 
                I wasn't sure where at that point but I knew there must be other exotic fish out there, although probably not as well documented as Mahseer, but possibly even more spectacular.”

                    The next journey to India was in 2005 in the Himalayan foothills and that was where he heard of horrific stories. 
                Stories of people going missing in the rivers, stories of washed up bodies with cuts all over the body and with that came the idea of a show called “River Monsters”. 
                With the show finding its roots, Wade pulled out his gear and started looking for the monstrous fish that would mark the start of Episode 1 of River Monsters. 
                As he finally hooked onto a powerful fish he had to endure the dangerous waters below him and even swam in the strong currents to keep the fish on. 
                With the fight coming to an end after an hour it was revealed to be a 161 pound Goonch catfish, 
                the largest catfish known in the area. With the first episode of River Monsters being aired, it gained almost a million viewers and with the Goonch catfish being shown in the second episode 
                it was likely that the viewership would only continue to rise.
