                    Being a foreigner in a foreign nation it comes with many unknown dangers to Jeremy Wade and the crew that follows him. 
                One of the dangers that was not expected was an episode where the soundman, Chris, was struck by lightning during a journey to find food. 
                Being lucky to have rubber sole boots, Chris manages to survive and return to camp safely. 
                Another mistake Wade makes is when he is fishing on Nong Khai which borders another country called Laos. After straying too far away from the Nong Khai border, border patrol is led to his boat and he is nearly arrested and his trip is cut short. The biggest failure that Jeremy Wade has ever encountered was with his fight with the Giant Freshwater Stingray. The one that he catches is not the first Stingray that Jeremy landed. His first attempt was believed to be the largest Giant Freshwater Stingray anyone has ever caught. Believed to be at 700 pounds Wade fights this creature for over an hour and snaps his tendon trying to reel the fish in. Snapping his tendon caused a permanent effect on his arm as there is no longer any muscle in his bicep area and even after the long fight his rod finally gives in. 
                The rod snaps, and takes the beast with it deep into the murky waters of Southeast Asia.
