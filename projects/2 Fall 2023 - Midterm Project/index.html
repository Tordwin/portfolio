                <p><strong>Lagoon sang and produced by Rich Brian</strong><br>
                    Released in 2022 with the album of <strong>Brightside</strong>, 
                    Lagoon brings a rich and fastbeat style of rap that Rich Brian has adapted and evolved.
                    Alongside other songs like Getcho Mans, Sunny and New Tooth, Lagoon punches you in the face 
                    as when you press play and gives you the chills as it slows down towards the end.

                <p><strong>Runnin sang by 21 Savage. Produced By Metro Boomin</strong><br>
                    Released in 2020 with the album <strong>Savage Mode II</strong>,
                    Runnin brings a hard hitting rap song to drive with.
                    The combination of the bass and the lyrics makes you feel as if
                    you are racing through the streets. 
                    This song never fails to make me feel good. 
                    Give it a listen when you wanna break the speed limits.

                    Released in 2018 eventide is another hit with kudasaibeats. Recently released with <strong>afterthoughts (unreleased singles)</strong>
                    his Lo-Fi exploration allows the calmness to hit the listener through the bass
                    and the rythmetic guitar. Even as a loop, it gives me the calmness as I am driving in the middle of the night.
